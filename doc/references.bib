  abstract = {Large Eddy Simulations are inherently dynamic as the largest scales are resolved and the smallest scales are modeled temporally. This raises challenges for simulations including very large scales such as atmospheric flows, which require very long simulation times. Simple averages fail at capturing these dynamics and potentially yield misleading interpretations concerning the capabilities of different models when tested in blind tests or in benchmarking exercises such as Wakebench, where results from different flow models are compared. This article will present results from very large wind farm simulations using Actuator Disc (AD) and Line (AL) models for two different turbine spacings with turbulent inflow. The results of each numerical flow model include a certain variability, and it will be examined if different models result in comparable probability distributions.},

  abstract = {Optimal design of wind farms in complex terrains has never been fully addressed because of the complex flow phenomena generated by the turbine wakes, the terrain itself, and their mutual interaction. To capture these effects, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models are necessary, but their direct use with traditional optimization algorithms is prevented by their high computational cost. By using a gradient-based algorithm and an adjoint method for the gradient calculations, we present a methodology for the optimization of wind farm layouts that enables the use of CFD models to accurately simulate wake effects and terrain-induced flow characteristics. As opposed to previous studies, this methodology is general in its formulation and can handle different wind farm configurations, wind resource distributions and terrain topography. Benefits of an optimal wind farm design that employs CFD models are demonstrated for idealized and real cases, where significant improvements in annual energy production are realized by optimally siting turbines over complex terrains exploiting both turbine- and terrain-induced flow features. We ultimately show that this innovative methodology is feasible with current computational resources and an optimization process can be completed within days.},

However, internal information about objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing a manufacturing line's throughput with simulation, we observe the number of parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput. Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve performance. We call these "grey-box" BO methods because they treat objective computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box approach with so-called "white-box" first-principles knowledge of objective function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.},

  abstract = {This study presents a data-driven approach for optimizing the operating altitude of Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) systems to maximize net energy production. Determining the optimal operating altitude of an AWE system is challenging, as the wind speed constantly varies with both time and altitude. Furthermore, without expensive auxiliary equipment, the wind speed is only measurable at the AWE system's operating altitude. The work presented in this paper shows how tools from machine learning can be blended with real-time control to optimize the AWE system's operating altitude efficiently, without the use of auxiliary wind profiling equipment. Specifically, Bayesian Optimization, which is a data-driven technique for finding the optimum of an unknown and expensive-to-evaluate objective function, is applied to the real-time control of an AWE system. The underlying objective function is modeled by a Gaussian Process (GP); then, Bayesian Optimization utilizes the predictive uncertainty information from the GP to decide the best subsequent operating altitude. In the AWE application, conventional Bayesian Optimization is extended to handle the time-varying nature of the wind shear profile (wind speed vs. time). Using real wind data, our method is validated against three baseline approaches. Our simulation results show that the Bayesian Optimization method is successful in dramatically increasing power production over these baselines.},

  abstract = {Maximising the power production of large wind farms is key to the transition towards net zero. The overarching goal of this paper is to propose a computational method to maximise the power production of wind farms with two practical design strategies. First, we propose a gradient-free method to optimise the wind farm power production with high-fidelity surrogate models based on large-eddy simulations and a Bayesian framework. Second, we apply the proposed method to maximise wind farm power production by both micrositing (layout optimisation) and wake steering (yaw angle optimisation). Third, we compare the optimisation results with the optimisation achieved with low-fidelity wake models. Finally, we propose a simple multi-fidelity strategy by combining the inexpensive wake models with the high-fidelity framework. The proposed gradientfree method can effectively maximise wind farm power production. Performance improvements relative to wakemodel optimisation strategies can be attained, particularly in scenarios of increased flow complexity, such as in the wake steering problem, in which some of the assumptions in the simplified flow models become less accurate. The optimisation with high-fidelity methods takes into account nonlinear and unsteady fluid mechanical phenomena, which are leveraged by the proposed framework to increase the farm output. This paper opens up opportunities for wind farm optimisation with high-fidelity methods and without adjoint solvers.},

  abstract = {Surrogate algorithms such as Bayesian optimisation are especially designed for black-box optimisation problems with expensive objectives, such as hyperparameter tuning or simulation-based optimisation. In the literature, these algorithms are usually evaluated with synthetic benchmarks which are well established but have no expensive objective, and only on one or two real-life applications which vary wildly between papers. There is a clear lack of standardisation when it comes to benchmarking surrogate algorithms on real-life, expensive, black-box objective functions. This makes it very difficult to draw conclusions on the effect of algorithmic contributions and to give substantial advice on which method to use when. A new benchmark library, EXPObench, provides first steps towards such a standardisation. The library is used to provide an extensive comparison of six different surrogate algorithms on four expensive optimisation problems from different real-life applications. This has led to new insights regarding the relative importance of exploration, the evaluation time of the objective, and the used model. We also provide rules of thumb for which surrogate algorithm to use in which situation. A further contribution is that we make the algorithms and benchmark problem instances publicly available, contributing to more uniform analysis of surrogate algorithms. Most importantly, we include the performance of the six algorithms on all evaluated problem instances. This results in a unique new dataset that lowers the bar for researching new methods as the number of expensive evaluations required for comparison is significantly reduced.},

This type of problem appears when dealing with computationally expensive simulators or algorithms. By approximating the expensive part of the optimisation problem with a surrogate, the number of expensive function evaluations can be reduced. This paper defines sustainable SBO, which consists of three aspects: applying SBO to a sustainable application, reducing the number of expensive function evaluations, and considering the computational effort of the machine learning and optimisation parts of SBO. The paper reviews sustainable applications that have successfully applied SBO over the past years, and analyses the used framework, type of surrogate used, sustainable SBO aspects, and open questions. This leads to recommendations for researchers working on sustainability-related applications who want to apply SBO, as well as recommendations for SBO researchers. It is argued that transparency of the computation resources used in the SBO framework, as well as developing SBO techniques that can deal with a large number of variables and objectives, can lead to more sustainable SBO.},

These models are known to have accuracy issues, in particular since their representation of wake interaction is very simple. In the present work, we propose an optimisation approach that is based on a hybrid combination of large-eddy simulation (LES) and the Jensen model; in this approach, optimisation is mainly performed using the Jensen model, and LES is used at a few points only during optimisation for online tuning of the wake-expansion coefficient in the Jensen model, as well as for validation of the results. An optimisation case study is considered, in which the placement of 30 turbines in a 4 km by 3 km rectangular domain is optimised in a neutral atmospheric boundary layer. Optimisation for both a single wind direction and multiple wind directions is discussed.},

  abstract = {The development of large scale wind farms that can compete with conventional energy resources presents significant challenges to today's wind energy industry. A powerful solution to these daunting challenges can be offered by a synergistic consideration of the key design elements (turbine selection and placement) and the variations in the natural resource. This paper significantly advances the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO) method, enabling it to simultaneously optimize the placement and the selection of turbines for commercial-scale wind farms that are subject to varying wind conditions. The advanced UWFLO method avoids the following limiting traditional assumptions: (i) array/grid-wise layout pattern, (ii) fixed wind condition, or unimodal and univariate distribution of wind conditions, and (iii) the specification of a fixed and uniform type of turbine to be installed in the farm. Novel modifications are made to the formulation of the inter-turbine wake interactions, which allow turbines with differing features and power characteristics to be considered in the UWFLO method. The annual energy production is estimated using the joint distribution of wind speed and direction. A recently developed Kernel Density Estimation-based model that can adequately represent multimodal wind data is employed to characterize the wind distribution. A response surface-based wind farm cost model is also developed and implemented to evaluate and favorably constrain the Cost of Energy of the designed farm. The selection of commercially available turbines introduces discrete variables into the optimization problem; this challenging problem is solved using an advanced mixed-discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of this wind farm optimization methodology is illustrated by applying it to design a 25-turbine wind farm in N. Dakota. A remarkable improvement of 6.4\% in the farm capacity factor is accomplished when the farm layout and the turbine selection are simultaneously optimized.},

This methodology simultaneously determines the optimum farm layout and the appropriate selection of turbines (in terms of their rotor diameters) that maximizes the net power generation. The farm layout model obviates traditional restrictions imposed on the location of turbines. A standard analytical wake model has been used to account for the velocity deficits in the wakes created by individual turbines. The wind farm power generation model is validated against data from a wind tunnel experiment on a scaled down wind farm. Reasonable agreement between the model and experimental results is obtained. The complex nonlinear optimization problem presented by the wind farm model is effectively solved using constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It is found that an optimal combination of wind turbines with differing rotor diameters can appreciably improve the farm efficiency. A preliminary wind farm cost analysis is performed to express the cost in terms of the turbine rotor diameters and the number of turbines in the farm. Subsequent exploration of the influences of (i) the number of turbines, and (ii) the farm land size, on the cost per Kilowatt of power produced, yields important observations.},

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15\% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4\% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1\% accuracy).},

Its unique properties lie on the use of higher-order numerical schemes with ``spectral-like'' accuracy, a highly efficient parallelisation strategy which allows the code to scale up to O(104) computing processors and software compactness (use of only native solvers/models) with virtually no dependence to external libraries. The work presents an overview of the current modelling capabilities along with model validation. The presented applications demonstrate the ability of WInc3D to be used for testing farm-level optimal control strategies using turbine wakes under yawed conditions. Examples are provided for two turbines operating in-line as well as a small array of 16 turbines operating under ``Greedy'' and ``Co-operative'' yaw angle settings. These large-scale simulations were performed with up to 8192 computational cores for under 24 hours, for a computational domain discretised with O(109) mesh nodes.},

In some real-world settings, such as randomized controlled trials or A/B tests, it may not be possible to measure policy outcomes at the level of context---we observe only aggregate rewards across a distribution of contexts. This makes policy optimization much more difficult because we must solve a high-dimensional optimization problem over the entire space of contextual policies, for which existing optimization methods are not suitable. We develop effective models that leverage the structure of the search space to enable contextual policy optimization directly from the aggregate rewards using Bayesian optimization. We use a collection of simulation studies to characterize the performance and robustness of the models, and show that our approach of inferring a low-dimensional context embedding performs best. Finally, we show successful contextual policy optimization in a real-world video bitrate policy problem.},

Unfortunately, the classical, sequential setting of Bayesian Optimization does not translate well into laboratory experiments, for instance battery design, where measurements may come from different sources and their evaluations may require significant waiting times. Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization addresses the setting with measurements from different sources. Asynchronous batch Bayesian Optimization provides a framework to select new experiments before the results of the prior experiments are revealed. This paper proposes an algorithm combining multi-fidelity and asynchronous batch methods. We empirically study the algorithm behavior, and show it can outperform single-fidelity batch methods and multi-fidelity sequential methods.

However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These could either be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. Batch methods, however, require the modeling of the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate this issue and propose a highly effective heuristic based on an estimate of the function's Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction--local repulsion--at negligible computational overhead. A penalized acquisition function is used to collect batches of points minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The resulting algorithm compares very well, in run-time, with much more elaborate alternatives.},

The proposed algorithm calculates the yearly income due to the sale of the net generated energy taking into account the individual wind turbine loss of production due to wake decay effects and it can deal with areas or terrains with non-uniform load-bearing capacity soil and different roughness length for every wind direction or restrictions such as forbidden areas or limitations in the number of wind turbines or the investment. The results are first favorably compared with those previously published and a second collection of test cases is used to proof the performance and suitability of the proposed evolutive algorithm to find the optimum wind farm configuration.}

  abstract = {Modern large-scale wind farms consist of multiple turbines clustered together, usually in well-structured formations. Clustering has a number of drawbacks during a wind farm's operation, as some of the downstream turbines will inevitably operate in the wake of those upstream, with a significant reduction in power output and an increase in fatigue loads. Wake steering, a control strategy in which upstream wind turbines are misaligned with the wind to redirect their wakes away from downstream turbines, is a promising strategy to mitigate power losses. The purpose of this work is to investigate the sensitivity of open-loop wake steering optimisation in which an internal predictive wake model is used to determine the farm power output as a function of the turbine yaw angles. Three different layouts are investigated with increasing levels of complexity. A simple 2{\texttimes}1 farm layout under aligned conditions is first considered, allowing for a careful investigation of the sensitivity to wake models and operating conditions. A medium-complexity case of a generic 5{\texttimes}5 farm layout under aligned conditions is examined to enable the study of a more complex design space. The final layout investigated is the Horns Rev wind farm (80 turbines), for which there have been very few studies of the performance or sensitivity of wake steering optimisation. Overall, the results indicate a strong sensitivity of wake steering strategies to both the analytical wake model choice and the particular implementation of algorithms used for optimisation. Significant variability can be observed in both farm power improvement and optimal yaw settings, depending on the optimisation setup. Through a statistical analysis of the impact of optimiser initialisation and a study of the multi-modal and discontinuous nature of the underlying farm power objective functions, this study shows that the uncovered sensitivities represent a fundamental challenge to robustly identifying globally optimal solutions for the high-dimensional optimisation problems arising from realistic wind farm layouts. This paper proposes a simple strategy for sensitivity mitigation by introducing additional optimisation constraints, leading to higher farm power improvements and more consistent, coherent, and practicable optimal yaw angle settings.},

Bayesian optimisation can improve responses to many optimisation problems within climate change for which simulator models are unavailable or expensive to sample from. While there have been several feasibility demonstrations of Bayesian optimisation in climate-related applications, there has been no unifying review of applications and benchmarks. We provide such a review here, to encourage the use of Bayesian optimisation in important and well-suited application domains. We identify four main application domains: material discovery, wind farm layout, optimal renewable control and environmental monitoring. For each domain we identify a public benchmark or data set that is easy to use and evaluate systems against, while being representative of real-world problems. Due to the lack of a suitable benchmark for environmental monitoring, we propose LAQN-BO, based on air pollution data. Our contributions are: a) identifying a representative range of benchmarks, providing example code where necessary; b) introducing a new benchmark, LAQN-BO; and c) promoting a wider use of climate change applications among Bayesian optimisation practitioners.},

Current practice in estimating the benefit of wake steering on the annual energy production (AEP) consists of evaluating the wind farm with simplified surrogate models, casting a large uncertainty on the estimated benefit. This paper presents a framework for determining the benefit of wake steering on the AEP, incorporating simulation results from a surrogate model and large eddy simulations in order to reduce the uncertainty. Furthermore, a time-varying wind direction is considered for a better representation of the ambient conditions at the real wind farm site. Gaussian process regression is used to combine the two data sets into a single improved model of the energy gain. This model estimates a 0.60\% gain in AEP for the considered wind farm, which is a 76\% increase compared to the estimate of the surrogate model.},

  abstract = {When a wind turbine works in yaw, the wake intensity and the power production of the turbine become slightly smaller and a deflection of the wake is induced. Therefore, a good understanding of this effect would allow an active control of the yaw angle of upstream turbines to steer the wake away from downstream machines, reducing its effect on them. In wind farms where interaction between turbines is significant, it is of interest to maximize the power output from the wind farm as a whole and to reduce fatigue loads on downstream turbines due to the increase of turbulence intensity in wakes. A large eddy simulation model with particular wind boundary conditions has been used recently to simulate and characterize the turbulence generated by the presence of a wind turbine and its evolution downstream the machine. The simplified turbine is placed within an environment in which relevant flow properties like wind speed profile, turbulence intensity and the anisotropy of turbulence are found to be similar to the ones of the neutral atmosphere. In this work, the model is used to characterize the wake deflection for a range of yaw angles and thrust coefficients of the turbine. The results are compared with experimental data obtained by other authors with a particle image velocimetry technique from wind tunnel experiments.

To better predict these effects with low computational costs, we develop data-driven emulators of the `local' or `internal' turbine thrust coefficient CT{$\ast$} as a function of turbine layout. We train the model using a multi-fidelity Gaussian process (GP) regression with a combination of low (engineering wake model) and high-fidelity (large eddy simulations) simulations of farms with different layouts and wind directions. A large set of low-fidelity data speeds up the learning process and the high-fidelity data ensures a high accuracy. The trained multi-fidelity GP model is shown to give more accurate predictions of CT{$\ast$} compared to a standard (single-fidelity) GP regression applied only to a limited set of high-fidelity data. We also use the multi-fidelity GP model of CT{$\ast$} with the two-scale momentum theory (Nishino \& Dunstan 2020, J. Fluid Mech. 894, A2) to demonstrate that the model can be used to give fast and accurate predictions of large wind farm performance under various mesoscale atmospheric conditions.

EMs are fast and accurate for an overview of WFA and gauging mean power production, but cannot resolve phenomena like wake meandering, effect of atmospheric stratification on wake development, a turbine׳s response to partial wake interaction and yawed inflows etc., and their relation with turbine loading, which require a first principle physics-based model, namely Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Although advances in computer technology have promoted the application of CFD, the study of WFA is yet unworkable with Direct Numerical Simulation, which is the most comprehensive CFD technique. Thus, as a trade-off between cost and detail, researchers must resort to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to garner thorough knowledge of WFA, which could in succession help the industry improve engineering models. This paper summarises the contributions of various LES investigations into WFA and how they have helped broaden our understanding of the subject. Additionally, the article touches upon the optimal use of LES and of the resultant data, and also the challenges faced by LES.},

  abstract = {Variations in wind states are generally ignored while designing the wind farm layouts. As a result, given the highly uncertain nature of wind the ability of the wind farms to produce power on a sustained basis gets severely affected in the long run. In this study, a robust optimization methodology has been proposed and successfully adopted to design wind farm layouts (optimum number and location of wind turbines) that are immune to varying wind state conditions. Assuming different realizations of wind state uncertainty distributions of wind speeds and directions, the proposed methodology provides uncertainty resilient robust solutions for the conservative worst case and the optimistic best case situations by adopting maximum and minimum extent of variations in uncertain parameters, respectively. Additionally, the flexibility introduced in the formulation enables a designer to create solution anywhere between these two extremes. This set of robust solutions provide with a realistic envelope for the farm performance parameters under uncertainty helping meeting the guaranteed service levels. It has been observed that the turbine layout corresponds to the worst case can produce an average of {\textasciitilde}49\% more power than the guaranteed value and provide with 100\% success rate on meeting the service levels under changing wind conditions. Representing the wind farm by uniform set of coarse grids initially, need based grids of variable resolution along with novel repair operator are adopted to generate Pareto solutions for the multi-objective cost-power trade-off problem. The proposed grid based technique is validated against other techniques of no-grid and grid with fixed resolution and improvements of {\textasciitilde}9.0\% in power production and {\textasciitilde}1.7\% in the ratio of cost and power can be seen. Furthermore, improvements of 75.7\% in produced power as compared to rigorously explored benchmark case study and 1e10\% in cost to power ratio compared to other techniques presented in literature, show the merits of the proposed technique.},

  abstract = {Improving the power output from wind farms is vital in transitioning to renewable electricity generation. However, in wind farms, wind turbines often operate in the wake of other turbines, leading to a reduction in the wind speed and the resulting power output whilst also increasing fatigue. By using wake steering strategies to control the wake behind each turbine, the total wind farm power output can be increased. To find optimal yaw configurations, typically analytical wake models have been utilised to model the interactions between the wind turbines through the flow field. In this work we show that, for full wind farms, higher-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations, in the form of large eddy simulations, are able to find more optimal yaw configurations than analytical wake models. This is because they capture and exploit more of the physics involved in the interactions between the multiple turbine wakes and the atmospheric boundary layer. As large eddy simulations are much more expensive to run than analytical wake models, a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation framework is introduced. This implements a multi-fidelity surrogate model, that is able to capture the non-linear relationship between the analytical wake models and the large eddy simulations, and a multi-fidelity acquisition function to determine the configuartion and fidelity of each optimisation iteration. This allows for fewer configurations to be evaluated with the more expensive large eddy simulations than a single-fidelity optimisation, whilst producing comparable optimisation results. The same total wind farm power improvements can then be found for a reduced computational cost.},

The large computational cost that restricted CFD simulation for such a task is drastically reduced by means of a novel interpolation-extrapolation methodology, requiring the simulation of only three inlet velocities for each wind rose sector. This methodology is based on the velocity at met mast and results of the reference velocity for each wind turbine from pre-simulated cases, which are then used to compute a wide range of cases not explicitly simulated. A comparative study is carried out, in which the measured capacity factor of an onshore wind farm in the Argentinean Patagonia is compared against different solution approaches. In the particular case of this wind farm, it is found that the separate effects of wakes and terrain produce errors in the opposite sense, and results very close to the measured value are achieved when both are considered. Also, the increase in the number of simulated direction sectors from 16 to 32 does not significantly change the results.}

  abstract = {In this work, CFD simulation along with the site complete wind rose are used for the first time to estimate a key magnitude for the project development of a wind farm, the capacity factor, which is directly related with the energy yield. The large computational cost that restricted CFD simulation for such a task is drastically reduced by means of a novel interpolation-extrapolation methodology, requiring the simulation of only three inlet velocities for each wind rose sector. This methodology is based on the velocity at met mast and results of the reference velocity for each wind turbine from pre-simulated cases, which are then used to compute a wide range of cases not explicitly simulated. A comparative study is carried out, in which the measured capacity factor of an onshore wind farm in the Argentinean Patagonia is compared against different solution approaches. In the particular case of this wind farm, it is found that the separate effects of wakes and terrain produce errors in the opposite sense, and results very close to the measured value are achieved when both are considered. Also, the increase in the number of simulated direction sectors from 16 to 32 does not significantly change the results.},

  abstract = {Wind farm power production is known to be strongly affected by turbine wake effects. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a new analytical model for the prediction of wind turbine wakes and the associated power losses in wind farms. The new model is an extension of the one recently proposed by Bastankhah and Port{\'e}-Agel for the wake of stand-alone wind turbines. It satisfies the conservation of mass and momentum and assumes a self-similar Gaussian shape of the velocity deficit. The local wake growth rate is estimated based on the local streamwise turbulence intensity. Superposition of velocity deficits is used to model the interaction of the multiple wakes. Furthermore, the power production from the wind turbines is calculated using the power curve. The performance of the new analytical wind farm model is validated against power measurements and large-eddy simulation (LES) data from the Horns Rev wind farm for a wide range of wind directions, corresponding to a variety of full-wake and partial-wake conditions. A reasonable agreement is found between the proposed analytical model, LES data, and power measurements. Compared with a commonly used wind farm wake model, the new model shows a significant improvement in the prediction of wind farm power.},

We apply the framework on data from 19 offshore wind farms. Our results show that the new wake model TurbOPark is overall unbiased and that the wake model error at each specific site does not depend on the mean turbine spacing. The Park model underestimates the wake loss unless a slower wake expansion than typically used is assumed. In either case, the Park model tends to underestimate the wake loss more for increasing distances between the turbines. We estimate the wake model uncertainty as less than 10\% of the wake loss for the considered models.},

Various wind farms with fixed stream-wise spacing (7.85 rotor diameters) and varying lateral displacements and span-wise turbine spacings are considered, for a fixed inflow direction. Simulations show that, contrary to common belief, a perfectly staggered (checker-board) configuration does not necessarily give the highest average power output. Instead, the highest mean wind farm power output is found to depend on several factors, the most important one being the alignment that leads to minimization of wake effects from turbines in several upstream rows. This alignment typically occurs at significantly smaller angles than those corresponding to perfect staggering. The observed trends have implications for wind farm designs, especially in sites with a well-defined prevailing wind direction.},

Some characteristics of the simple models may negatively influence the resulting layouts. In this paper, we perform wind farm layout optimization using a simple wake model and compare the resulting improvements to large-eddy simulation (LES) results to confirm that the layout was actually improved. We begin by describing the models used, including changes specific for use with gradient-based optimization. We then compare our models' output to previously published model and LES results. Using the models described, we performed gradient-based wind farm layout optimization using exact gradients. Power production for the original and optimized layouts were recalculated using LES. The model and LES results were then compared. The simple models predicted an improvement in annual energy production (AEP) of 7.4\%, while the LES reported an AEP improvement of 9.9\%. We concluded that the improvements found by optimizing with the simple models are not just an artifact of the model characteristics, but are real improvements.},

These objective functions arise in multi-task Bayesian optimization for tuning machine learning hyperparameters, optimization via simulation, and sequential design of experiments with random environmental conditions. Our method is average-case optimal by construction when a single evaluation of the integrand remains within our evaluation budget. Achieving this one-step optimality requires solving a challenging value of information optimization problem, for which we provide a novel efficient discretization-free computational method. We also provide consistency proofs for our method in both continuum and discrete finite domains for objective functions that are sums. In numerical experiments comparing against previous state-of-the-art methods, including those that also leverage sum or integral structure, our method performs as well or better across a wide range of problems and offers significant improvements when evaluations are noisy or the integrand varies smoothly in the integrated variables.},

During the past 3 years, the wind research community has invested significant effort toward understanding the nature and implications of these challenges and identifying associated gaps.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to accurately characterize and predict the annual variation of wind conditions. The estimate of the distribution of wind conditions is necessary to quantify the available energy (power density) at a site, and to design optimal wind farm configurations. A smooth multivariate wind distribution model is developed to capture the coupled variation of wind speed, wind direction, and air density. The wind distribution model developed in this paper avoids the limiting assumption of unimodality of the distribution. This method, which we call the Multivariate and Multimodal Wind Distribution (MMWD) model, is an evolution from existing wind distribution modeling techniques. Multivariate kernel density estimation, a standard non-parametric approach to estimate the probability density function of random variables, is adopted for this purpose. The MMWD technique is successfully applied to model (i) the distribution of wind speed (univariate); (ii) the joint distribution of wind speed and wind direction (bivariate); and (iii) the joint distribution of wind speed, wind direction, and air density (multivariate). The latter is a novel contribution of this paper, while the former offers opportunities for validation. Both onshore and offshore wind distributions are estimated using the MMWD model. Recorded wind data, obtained from the North Dakota Agricultural Weather Network (NDAWN) and the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), is used in this paper. The coupled distribution was found to be multimodal. A strong correlation among the wind condition parameters was also observed.}
